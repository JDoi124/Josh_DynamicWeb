  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>A Brief History and Domestic Policy</p>
</div>
</section>

<div class="historyinfo"> 
  <h1> <b>The Early Stages</b> </h1>
    <p>Why are drugs legal and other drugs illegal today? It has nothing to do based on any scientific assessment of the relative risks of these drugs, however it does involve with everything to do with who is associated with these drugs.</p>

<p>The first prohibition was on anti-opium laws in the 1870s, which were directed at Chinese immigrants. The second prohibition was on anti-cocaine laws, in the South in the early 1900s, it was directed towards black men. The third prohibition was anti-marijuana laws, in the Midwest and the Southwest in the 1910s and 20s, which were directed at Mexican migrants and Mexican Americans. </p>

  <h1><b>The Rise of Nixon and Drug Prohibition</b></h1>
    <p> In the 1960s, drugs became a symbol of youthful rebellion, social upheaval, and political dissent, the government had stopped scientific research to evaluate their medical safety and efficacy.</p>

    <p>In June 1971, President Nixon declared a <b>“war on drugs.”</b> He pushed through measures such as <b>mandatory sentencing in jail</b> and no-knock search warrants. Nixon had temporarily placed marijuana in <b>Schedule One</b>, the most restrictive category of drugs, pending review by a commission he appointed led by Republican Pennsylvania Governor Raymond Shafer. In 1972, the commission unanimously recommended decriminalizing the possession and distribution of marijuana for personal use. Nixon ignored the report and rejected its recommendations.</p>

    <p>Between 1973 and 1977, eleven states had decriminalized marijuana possession. In January 1977, President Jimmy Carter was inaugurated on a campaign platform that included marijuana decriminalization. In October 1977, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to decriminalize possession of up to an ounce of marijuana for personal use.</p>

    <h1><b>Drug Hysteria and Massive Incarceration Rates</b></h1>
      <p>The reign of Ronald Reagan marked the start of a long period of <b>massive rates of incarceration,</b> largely thanks to his unprecedented expansion of the drug war. The number of people behind bars for nonviolent drug law offenses increased from 50,000 in 1980 to over <b>400,000</b> by 1997.</p>

      <p>The public had concerns about illicit drug use built throughout the 1980s, largely due to media portrayals of people addicted to the smokeable form of cocaine dubbed <b>“crack.”</b> Soon after Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, his wife, Nancy Reagan, began a highly-publicized anti-drug campaign, coining the slogan <b>"Just Say No."</b></p>

      <p>In the late 1980s, a political hysteria about drugs led to the passage of draconian penalties, which rapidly increased the prison population.</p>

        <p> As George W. Bush arrived in the White House during his reign as president, the drug war was running out of steam, yet he had invested more money than ever to it. His drug advisor, John Walters, zealously focused on marijuana and launched a major campaign to promote <b>student drug testing</b>. The rates of illicit drug use remained the same and consistant. </p>

        <p>The era of George W. Bush also witnessed the rapid escalation of the militarization of domestic drug law enforcement. By the end of Bush's term, there were about <b>40,000</b> paramilitary-style SWAT raids on Americans every year mostly for nonviolent drug law offenses, often misdemeanors. While federal reform mostly stalled under Bush, state-level reforms finally began to reinstate the growth of the drug war.</p>
